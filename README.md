# Customer Segmentation Clustering

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this assignment is to understand and implement different clustering techniques for customer segmentation. The goal is to interpret the significance of the clusters formed and provide actionable insights.

## Data
- **Dataset:** [Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hashemi221022/customer-segmentation-data/data)
- **File Name:** `Customer_Data.csv`

## Requirements

### Data Preprocessing [5 marks]
- Clean and prepare the data. Address data issues, perform feature scaling, encoding, and other relevant transformations.
- If applicable, use dimensionality reduction and discuss its impact on the clusters.
- Explain the data preparation process.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) [5 marks]
- Perform an EDA to understand the data and identify patterns that could inform the clustering.
- Explain the findings.

### Clustering Algorithms [10 marks]
- Implement at least three different clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN).
- Use techniques such as the Elbow method, Silhouette analysis, or others to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Discuss each method and select the most appropriate.

### Interpreting Clusters [5 marks]
- Characterize the clusters formed: Describe the types of customers in each cluster and the most significant features distinguishing them.

### Actionable Insights [5 marks]
- Provide business recommendations based on the clusters formed. Suggest strategies for targeting different customer segments.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Quality of Data Preprocessing and EDA [10 marks]
- Correct implementation and justification for selecting clustering algorithms [10 marks]
- Interpretation of clusters and quality of business insights & recommendations [10 marks]
- Code quality and report quality (including spelling and grammar) [5 marks]

## Deliverables
- A Jupyter Notebook containing all code
- Markdown comments in the Jupyter Notebook with answers to qualitative questions
